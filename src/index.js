// By default, create-react-app will cause the browser to refresh the page whenever its source code is modified
// The most useful benefit of HMR is that you can keep the application state after the application reloads. 
// For instance, assume you have a dialog or wizard in your application with multiple steps, and you are on step 3. 
// Without HMR, you make changes to the source code and your browser refreshes the page. 
// You would then have to open the dialog again and navigate from step 1 to step 3 each time. 
// With HMR your dialog stays open at step 3, so you can debug from the exact point youâ€™re working on. 
// With the time saved from page loads, this makes HMR an invaluable tool for React developers.
